# crf-implementation
Conditional random fields implementation as a post processing algorithm for improving the mask generated. Here the function accepts two images and number of classes, one is original image in BGR format 
and another is masked image. It returns new masked imaged after applying crf algorithm. This can only be deployed on cpu.
